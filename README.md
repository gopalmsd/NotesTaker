## Functionality and concept used :

This application is very simple and user interactive interface which helps user to keep notes and and that can be viewed when they are needed.


+ Relative layout :

    A RelativeLayout is a very powerful utility for designing a user interface because it can eliminate nested view groups and keep your layout hierarchy flat, which improves performance. 

+ Mvvm model:

    It allows the developer to use the official library of Google. Now, this further allows developers for a strong and proper generation of components and other elements. In this model, the user is allowed to write custom XML attributes by using Binding adapters 

+ Room :

    The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. In particular, Room provides the following benefits:
    + Compile-time verification of SQL queries.
    + Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.
    Streamlined database migration paths
 

+ Live data :
    LiveData is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services. This awareness ensures LiveData only updates app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.

## Application and future scope

This app is currently in development stage.This app is tested and ready to use .
In future we aim this application to update with remainder alarm features to notify the notes
